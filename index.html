	<h2> Practical -3 : Making web-page live on github</h2>
	<h2>About Github :-</h2>
	 <p>GitHub allows people to store their work, as well as network with like-minded developers. The system facilitates the interaction of these people, who can view, or even access, each other's work and discuss errors, and of course, potential solutions. A code that runs from start to finish without error is ideal.</p>

	 <h2>About Frontend-development :-</h2>
	 <p>Everything on the page from the logo to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge of the look and feel of the website.

     Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens).</p>
